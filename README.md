# IOC Extractor Tool

The IOC Extractor is a lightweight Python script designed to extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, domain names, and file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) from unstructured plain text files. This tool is particularly useful for SOC (Security Operations Center) analysts, threat hunters, and incident responders who need to quickly identify and isolate IOCs from threat reports or log files.
